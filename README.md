## Requirements

Goal: log a focus session

Build a post api endpoint with node js and express

Simulate a meda task using ffmpeg like compressing a file or extracting audio

Store everything in mongodb

Api endpoint should accept session data, userid, start time, end time, media file path

When api is called simulate a media processing step

No need to actually process the file, just make it look like ffmpeg is being called

Save everything to mongodb with a flag indicating if everything was processed with clean success response

extra : upload the processed file onto aws s3 with a lambda element

Use postman or curl to test endpoint

Short 5 min presentation to walk through the code and what you built like a mini team demo
