# Eden.pm & Tutor10x Backend Hackathon

## Requirements

Goal: log a focus session

- Build a post api endpoint with node js and express
- Simulate a media task using ffmpeg like compressing a file or extracting audio
- Store everything in mongodb
- Api endpoint should accept session data, userid, start time, end time, media file path
- When api is called simulate a media processing step
- No need to actually process the file, just make it look like ffmpeg is being called
- Save everything to mongodb with a flag indicating if everything was processed with clean success response
- Use postman or curl to test endpoint

extra : upload the processed file onto aws s3 with a lambda element

Short 5 min presentation to walk through the code and what you built like a mini team demo:
